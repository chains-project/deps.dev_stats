versions[].isDefault: boolean

    If true, this is the default version of the package: the version that is installed when no version is specified. The precise meaning of this is system-specific, but it is commonly the version with the greatest version number, ignoring pre-release versions.
versions[].isDeprecated: boolean

    If true, this version has been marked as deprecated.


## GetDependents

GET /v3alpha/systems/{versionKey.system}/packages/{versionKey.name}/versions/{versionKey.version}:dependents

GetDependents returns information about the number of distinct packages known to depend on the given package version. Dependent counts are currently available for Go, npm, Cargo, Maven and PyPI.

Dependent counts are derived from the dependency graphs computed by deps.dev, which means that only public dependents are counted. As such, dependent counts should be treated as indicative of relative popularity rather than precisely accurate.

    Can be one of GO, NPM, CARGO, MAVEN, PYPI, NUGET.
versionKey.name: string

    The name of the package.
versionKey.version: string

    The version of the package.

Response

dependentCount: number

    The number of packages known to depend on this package version, either directly or indirectly. Note that this may be less than the sum of the direct and indirect dependent counts.
directDependentCount: number

    The number of packages known to depend directly on this package version.
indirectDependentCount: number

    The number of packages known to depend indirectly on this package version.

GetCapabilities

GET /v3alpha/systems/{versionKey.system}/packages/{versionKey.name}/versions/{versionKey.version}:capabilities

GetCapabilityRequest returns counts for direct and indirect calls to Capslock capabilities for a given package version. Currently only available for Go.

capabilities[].capability: string

    A Capslock capability, indicating that the packages uses this capability.
capabilities[].directCount: number
